# Other Worlds

**Other Worlds** is a story/planet pack combo that adds a **new star system** to Kerbal Space Program full of **custom-made planets**, as well as a **custom-made story**, first in KSP history.

## Requirements and Optional Mods

To play with this mod, you require to also install [**Kopernicus**](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases)

The mod also requires, but is already bunbled with, [VertexMitchellNetravaliHeightMap](https://github.com/pkmniako/Kopernicus_VertexMitchellNetravaliHeightMap) and [CTTP](https://github.com/Galileo88/Community-Terrain-Texture-Pack).

As optional mods, you can use *Enviromental Visual Enhancments*, *Scatterer* and *Parallax* for a more visually striking collection of planets.

You can also install [**Contract Configurator**](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/releases) for a small collection of custom contracts.

## Other Source code

This mod also includes some laser sail parts that require custom code to work. You can find that one [here](https://github.com/pkmniako/Other_Worlds-Reboot).
