		#LOC_OWR_Description_sail = After numerous advancements on material science and mini-spring engineering, the Laser Sail PSS-042 can deliver a tiny payload to interstellar speeds by the use of Lasers being focused on a small, 8 square meters sail. 
		#LOC_OWR_Description_sailBig = A sail built with incredibly light but strong materials that is designed to endure high accelerations from a laser to propel itself and a small payload into a interstellar path. It sports the company's logo on the front of the sail. Competitors say it can lead to overheating, but in reality it makes the product look hot.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriteAddonRTG = A small addon for the SPRITE Core that provides a small amount of electricity from the use of decaying radioactive elements. Though the power output is low, it can endure long voyages and should be enough for tiny probes too.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriteAddonBattery = A small addon for the SPRITE Core that provides a extra battery to a craft. With this extra amount of energy, a Sprite sail will be able to transmit more data home at once than without one.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_SpriteCore = Thanks to the amazing and magic world of miniaturization and in a collaboration with Probodobodyne Inc, Intervision has created a brutally small probe core designed for interstellar travel. Though it contains an antenna with range enough to talk home from Cercani, it's capabilities are small without any Addon that can be placed at the top of the core.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_SpriteDecoupler = After numerous complains of clients about "How the universe collapsed if we decoupled a sprite sail with a rocket-grade decoupler", we have created a small decoupler/fairing to protect and separate your Sprite Sail from your carrier craft!
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriteRCS = A small addon for the SPRITE Core that, unlike others, is placed at the bottom of the probe core. This extra part can provide RCS to a Sprite Sail to allow it to refine an interstellar path much better than with the standard "Point and hope" approach.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriteScienceGoo = A small addon for the SPRITE Core containing a bit of mystery goo. Watching how the Goo behaves when subjected to different situations outside our home system could be very educational. In difference to the current Mystery Goo container, this one can't have its experiments collected.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriteScienceGrav = A small addon for the SPRITE Core that captures and measures the elusive Negative Gravioli Particle, used for determining the precise strength of gravitational fields. Might be immune to Positive Gravioli Particles. This addon is also well known in the space industry as having the highest density of all experiments... Density as in funds per kilogram...
		#LOC_OWR_Description_spriceScienceThermometer = A small addon for the SPRITE Core where we crammed an oven thermometer into it. Surprisingly, it performed better that our highly-engineered space-grade thermometer.
		#LOC_OWR_Description_teraLaser = This squarish thing can generate an immense amount of light in the form of an invisible laser that can push laser sails from other worlds! It can be used to slow down from an interstellar trip or avoid having to pay the KSC to use their expensive antennas for the same purpose.
		
		#LOC_OWR_Name_ARIFACT1 = Vassa's Artifact
		#LOC_OWR_Name_ARIFACT2 = Pequar's Artifact
		
		#LOC_OWR_Name_ARIFACT1Rec = Vassa's Artifact (Recreation)
		#LOC_OWR_Desc_ARIFACT1Rec = A faithful recreation of the alien artifact found on the surface of Vassa. It has the same functions as the original one, with just a different color finish as the only difference it has. We also added a sticker to it, we had a few lying around.
		#LOC_OWR_Name_ARIFACT2Rec = Pequar's Artifact (Recreation)
		#LOC_OWR_Desc_ARIFACT2Rec = A faithful recreation of the alien artifact found on the surface of Pequar. We imitated every single possible radio frequency the original hardware could produce, in an effort to learn more about it. It even has the same color!
